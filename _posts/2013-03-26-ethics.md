## Ethic

    1. Access to computers--and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works--should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!
    2. All information should be free.
    3. Mistrust Authority--Promote Decentralization.
    4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.
    5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.
    6. Computers can change your life for the better.
