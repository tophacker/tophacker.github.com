<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p>1. Access to computers--and anything that might teach you something about the way the world works--should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative!</p>
<p>2. All information should be free.</p>
<p>3. Mistrust Authority--Promote Decentralization.</p>
<p>4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, age, race, or position.</p>
<p>5. You can create art and beauty on a computer.</p>
<p>6. Computers can change your life for the better.</p>
